This webpage was created in response to boot camp assignment to apply skills learnt in CSS- particularly Bootstrap. The portfolio is based on a previous portfolio created for an assignment and builds on it by using Bootstrap components instead of CSS grid or flexbox. It's an online portfolio to showcase the creators' work and enable prospective employers to contact them, as well as learn a bit more about them. It includes a section on the skills the creator expects to learn during their Bootcamp experience. Only the first two webpages featured in the 'work' section are clickable, the rest of the gallery is for prospective projects which will be added as the user progresses in their learning journey. 

## Installation

## Credits

The source code for this project is taken from study materials from the bootcamp, and then edited to fulfill the learning objectives provided. I also used Bootstrap and FontAwesome to provide styling elements and icons.
